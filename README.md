The purpose of this piece is to capture a moment in time, both physically and digitally. At the highest level-- there is an audio input(mic) connected through TouchDesigner that records the audio using AI backend (whisper, OpenAI).
It then calls whisper.cpp to run a loop every 3-5 secs [inside TEXT DAT]
We then append text segments to a [TABLE DAT] extracts keywords (top frequency keywords)
The frequency keywords are then thrown into a sentiment analysis that dynamically assigns the words a color

We then projection map on top of a fluid composite form, meant to represent the tension of manufacturing forms with organic forms, the tension between old and new.
